 * We want to add some extra flavour to markdown files.
 *
 * Meaning when we edit we don't always want to resolve files, we can construct
 * a list of all files that we have to resolve a specific name from.
 *
 * Imagine this input: !`false` There might be a file somewhere called
 * "false.mpp" inside the "datatypes" directory.
 *
 * We search the source directory to construct this list on each compilation run
 * and replace this kind of syntax with proper markdown links.
